        <h2>Compression</h2>
        <p>The PNG format is important as it represents one of many web standard tools that can be used to improve both
            accessibility and presentation. It may not be ideal for every single situation where a designer wants an
            image, but it has clear benefits over its seemingly identical sibling formats (such as JPEG). As mentioned
            before, PNG files don't lose quality when being compressed, which can be helpful depending on what the
            information being displayed is. Additionally, PNG can be quite useful for more simple yet detailed web
            graphics.</p>
        <h2>Transparency</h2>
        <p>PNG files have another major difference, which is how they can handle transparency in images. Multiple levels
            of transparency can go a long way in making a site look flashier, with interesting web graphic designs.</p>
