        <h2>What Type of Image?</h2>
        <p>As opposed to the first image, this one is a PNG (Portable Network Graphic). Like JPG, it supports millions
            of colors, but unlike the former, it also supports many levels of transparency. It's the best of the worlds
            of
            JPG and GIF, and is well supported by browsers.</p>
        <h2>Why This One?</h2>
        <p>This one is yet another screenshot that comes from my Steam profile; while the first image showed a memorable
            moment with some friends, this one was exclusively taken because it just looked cool. I was really into
            <i>Elden Ring</i> around this time, and thought it would be cool to take a screenshot of my character summoning red
            lightning. Small as it was, I think I made a good choice that day.</p>
