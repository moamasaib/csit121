        <h2>Compression's Impact on Choice</h2>
        <p>The PNG format is important as it represents one of many web standard tools that can be used to improve both
            accessibility and presentation. Going back to the concept of compression, it may be hard to understand why
            somebody wouldn't use PNG if the seeming benefits are so good (consistent quality, colors, etc). The truth
            is, it isn't that simple,
            especially for those whose job it is to make websites look good without sacrificing quality or accessibility
            of content. PNG may not be ideal for every single
            situation where a designer wants an
            image, but it has clear benefits over its seemingly identical sibling formats (such as JPEG), which helps
            give designers more control over their sites. As mentioned
            before, PNG files may not suffer from quality loss with compression, but it does lead to larger file sizes.
            That is an example of something to think about
            when developing a site, even if most others would ignore it. Additionally, PNG can be quite useful for more
            simple yet detailed web
            graphics.</p>
        <h2>Transparency</h2>
        <p>PNG files have another major difference, which is how they can handle transparency in images. They contain
            multiple levels of transparency, unlike JPEG and GIF (GIF allows for one color to be configured as
            transparent). These multiple levels
            of transparency can go a long way in making a site look flashier, with interesting web graphic designs. This
            is especially important and useful for the more creative web designers (with pages much
            prettier than this), as they can use this transparency advantage to create some truly complex and incredible
            designs.
