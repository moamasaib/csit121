            <h3>Tables and Forms</h3>
            <p>For <u>Lab:07</u>, I was tasked with creating a tier-list page with a second page dedicated to collect
                user input. While I was able to create the structure of the tier list, I did not include any styling,
                which was a failure on my part. I also failed to offer forms and other methods of user interaction that
                would satisfy the requirements of the assignment. While I did some of it, this was without a doubt a
                failure on my part.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I have no showing for a Lab Assignment when it comes to Interactivity and JavaScript.</p>
