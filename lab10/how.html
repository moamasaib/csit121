        <h2>Web Graphics</h2>
        <p>PNG is often best used for detailed web graphics that aren't really intended to lose quality. The
            aforementioned lossless compression and color palette ensure that these web graphics can really pop and
            provide great amounts of detail, without worrying about quality drops. Additionally, their transparency
            support (something that JPEG doesn't have) is
            often used in order to make logos and other web graphics more complex; skilled designers can create graphics
            with layers of images, taking advantage of the transparency benefit.</p>
