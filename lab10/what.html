        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>PNG is one of many image file formats used for websites. It stands for "Portable Network Graphic", and this
            format is
            supported well by essentially all modern browsers. It dates back to the mid-90s, and was created as a sort
            of "replacement" for the GIF (Graphics Interchange Format). A
            somewhat interesting fact about PNG and its history is that it is not patented, and doesn't require any kind
            of licensing. This is worth noting because it was one of the main reasons for its creation, as the GIF
            started out being patented.
            Now, while this sounds nice at face value, it just refers to the <i>file format</i> itself; images within
            the actual PNG format can still be copyrighted obviously.</p>
        <h2>Attributes of the PNG</h2>
        <p>The poor range of colors in GIFs meant that many images wouldn't look good on websites. So, when the PNG was
            launched, it did so supporting millions of colors (quite the step up from just 256 with GIF!)
            and boasting
            incredible flexibility. PNGs are raster files - images constructed of tiny pixels that all come together to
            form a detailed image.<br>It also stores images using something called <b>lossless (or non-lossy)
                compression</b>. This means that when an image is compressed (reduced in size) it doesn't lose any data
            in the process, ensuring that the image doesn't get distorted.</p>
