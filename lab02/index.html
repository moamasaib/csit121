        <p> Remembering everything for structuring a webpage can be difficult. Even though I am fairly certain that I
            misplaced certain tags and misused others, I feel as though my experience and understanding is still
            growing. It is not as confusing as it looks!</p>

                    HTML is used to provide hierarchy and provide meaning for the content.

                    Structuring content is a fairly elegant process, and can be very personalized. Even though HTML has
                    standards, it is up to the web designer to make use of things like tags to make the website
                    appealing.

                    Placing elements in other elements, called nesting, can be used to emphasize certain statements.

            <p>Learning about HTML was fun, albeit a little confusing. I still need a lot of practice to engrain the
                information, and gaining understanding of the tagging system was part of that effort. I found it
                intriguing to learn about basic structure of HTML in particular. Some sites I used were: </p>
            <ul>

                        HTML Element Reference
                    </a>
