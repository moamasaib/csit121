            <h3>Visual and Media Elements</h3>
            <p>For <u>Lab:04</u>, I was tasked with creating a multipage site that showed common web graphic formats
                such as GIF, PNG, and JPEG. Each page had a web graphic dedicated to it, and I even used some personal
                images of my gaming sessions for two of them. The other was a GIF that I had to reference and give
                credit to online. It was freeing and quite fun to use images that I had captured myself.</p>

            <p><u>Lab:06</u> was all about me selecting a website and evaluating it based on the standards of User
                Interface and User Experience. I selected a simple National Park website and looked at things such as
                its design (and principles associated with it such as C.R.A.P - Contrast, Repetition, Alignment,
                Proximity) and how effective it was at meeting the desires of any potential visitor. It helped give me a
                different understanding about the end product of website design, and how the sites need to be designed
                for functionality.</p>
