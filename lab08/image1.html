        <h2>What Type of Image?</h2>
        <p>This image is a JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group). It supports millions of colors and is best used for
            photographs, but lacks in certain things like potential animation or transparency.</p>
        <h2>Why This One?</h2>
        <p>The first image I chose to use for this Lab Assignment was a screenshot from my Steam profile. I love gaming
            in my freetime, and on this particular day myself and a group of friends decided to play <i>Left 4 Dead 2</i> with
            a mod folder I had assembled. Taken on October 30th, the night before Halloween, it shows our player
            characters waiting in an elevator. One of my favorite recent screenshots for sure, as it shows a fun session
            between friends.</p>
