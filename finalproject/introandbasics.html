            <h3>Web Development Foundations</h3>
            <p><u>Lab:01</u> covered Web Developement Foundations and was fairly simple. It was all about practicing
                simple
                file management and just getting started with the structure of the course. In this Lab, I simply filled
                in a premade HTML file with some of my own personal information. It didn't have any sort of styling or
                advanced web standards like the later Modules would include.</p>

            <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
            <p><u>Lab:02</u> was all bout the basics of HTML and its structure. In this assignment, rather than filling
                out
                something already made for me as in Lab: 01, I had to construct my own page while following the
                hierarchal structure of HTML. Unfortunately, I didn't do that well and somewhat failed to understand the
                placement of certain elements, and proper uses of things such as headings. Still, I was able to improve
                after that Lab and have continued to do so.</p>

            <h3>CSS Basics</h3>
            <p>CSS Basics was put to the test in <u>Lab:03</u>, where I revisited the previous Lab and added styling to
                it. The Module specified the three types of styling used (inline, internal, external), but for the
                purpose of this assignment I was instructed to use an external CSS file, to get the hang of that method.
                This is because most websites contain multiple pages, and it's generally better practice to reference an
                external stylesheet rather than changing the style ruleset for every single page. I applied some simple
                (and questionable) styling to <u>Lab:02</u> and finished the assignment.</p>
