            <h3>Other Web Standards</h3>
            <p>This was <u>Lab:09</u>, and I was to code a simple XML page and create and HTML page that would read the
                data present in the XML. This was quite fun, though I did change a significant portion of the structure
                given to me through the Lab's linked website. I created some of my own headings and slightly changed
                things like the styling for my HTML page. I found the ways of using XML and its easily transferable
                information very intriguing.</p>

            <h3>Special Topics</h3>
            <p>After going through some special topics and other things present in Module 10, I was to select and web
                standard from a list (with some exceptions) and act as an educator on that particular standard for
                <u>Lab:10</u>. Ultimately, I think the website design was decent, but I failed to offer a lot of crucial
                information, and I was slighly repetitive in some of the pages as well. Still, I did structure
                everything and try to adhere to many of the web standards I learned throughout the semester.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>This project was fairly interesting, albeit very challenging. I found it quite difficult to go back to my
                other labs and attempt to integrate them properly into this whole portfolio. Very tedious if I'm being
                honest, but it also showed be the importance of being consistent; the web standards and conventional
                structure of website helped make it easier for me to reference my old work and place it
                here.</p>
            <p>Overall, I think that I learned a great deal during this semester regarding Web Development and
                Web
                Standards as a whole. While I can certainly admit that I was not as vigilant or motivated as I should
                have been, I truly did enjoy the vast majority of the learning experience present within this course.
                Regardless of my failures and lack of solid effort to match my very forgiving professor, I feel that I
                was still able to learn a lot throughout the course.</p>
            <p>Some particular challenges for me during all of
                my assignments was finding a way to match the basic HTML structure and continue to expand upon it each
                week with the Lab Assignments. Sometimes I would get confused and mess thing up, so I would often have
                to re-read the Learning Module content multiple times.</p>
            <p>Despite this all, I truly enjoyed the course,
                struggle and all, and think that it has expanded my knowledge on how the Web works, as well as the
                effort put into designing the sites I use every day.</p>
