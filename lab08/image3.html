        <h2>What Type of Image?</h2>
        <p>This one is a GIF image (Graphics Interchange Format). It supports a maximum of 256 colors and is often used
            for things like logos. They can also be still graphics, but are popular due to being animated. This
            particular GIF is obviously the latter.</p>
        <h2>Why This One?</h2>
        <p>As this one wasn't taken or made by me, it varies from the first two image choices. I chose this one simply
            because
            I love the winter season (it was also one of the best winter gifs I saw during my search). It's a really
            nice time and I think that snow is incredibly pretty. Perhaps I am a
            little biased, being that I was born in January, but I just think the wintertime is the best time of the
            year.</p>
