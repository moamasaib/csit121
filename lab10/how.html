        <h2>Web Graphics</h2>
        <p>PNG is often best used for detailed web graphics that aren't really intended to lose quality. The
            aforementioned lossless compression and color palette ensure that these web graphics can really pop and
            provide great amounts of detail, without worrying about quality drops. Additionally, their transparency
            support (something that JPEG doesn't have) is
            often used in order to make logos and other web graphics more complex; skilled designers can create graphics
            with layers of images, taking advantage of the transparency benefit.</p>

        <h2>Other Uses</h2>
        <p>PNGs, as stated before, are not really the best for things other than web graphics that need some complexity.
            In these cases, there are simply other formats that can do the job better, leaving PNG as a less desirable
            option. However, the PNG is most practically used for other things like charts, tables, and images that
            can't afford to sacrifice on their quality. PNGs aren't really in use when it comes to high quality and
            complex photographs, as the JPEG is better suited for those.</p>
