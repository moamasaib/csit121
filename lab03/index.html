            This is one of my first webpages. I'm getting the hang of applying tags and structuring, but looking back at
            the resources help make that easier. It's nice to know how webpages are made online, thanks to those guides
            posted in the learning modules.
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Tags should be lowercase, and can be nested or possess attributes.</li>
                <li>Headings communicate hierarchy and provide context for structure.</li>
                <li>Using lists, ordered (like this list here) or unordered.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Learning about HTML is incredibly interesting, especially knowing the amount that can be accomplished
                with a good plan and some ideas. I learned a lot about basic HTML structure and tags from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/html-tutorial/html-tags">This tutorial site</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introduction-to-html-basics/">And this site as well</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p id="NewReflection">After learning a lot about HTML structure following the Lab 02 assignment, it was nice
                experimenting with
                and further familiarizing myself with the language. Arranging the
                information in a way that flows and makes sense to the site visitor and anyone wanting to look at your
                code is important. It was also a lot of fun using CSS to
                experiment with different colors, font sizes, and other things to decorate the page and make it look
                pretty. I think this part especially helped me accept more that memorizing everything really is
                pointless; it's moreso about having an idea of what to do and then using the available resources to
                figure out how to execute that idea. I really appreciate the level of control that using CSS offers a
                designer, especially for people who specifically have a job to make the website look nice.</p>
